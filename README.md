## Purpose
###### I am template for a project that uses npm, webpack, eslint, babel and jest among others.See package.json for details

---
## Setup Requirements
 1. Clone project repo.
 2. Navigate to project folder via Terminal.
 3. If you do not plan to use `.env` it should be deleted and the dependency `"dotenv-webpack": "^2.0.0"` should be removed from package.json.
 4. Update the `name` and `description` properties in `package.json` to reflect the new project.
 5. From the command line run `npm install` to install all dependencies. 
 6. `npm run start` to start a live server
